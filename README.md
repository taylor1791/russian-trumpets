Russian National Anthem 
=======================

The Russian National Anthem with nothing but trumpets.

Purpose
-------

I know this guy. You could call him a hardcore Russian Chauvinista; he wakes up
to the Russian National Anthem everyday... (he is much better than he sounds).
He is going on an extended trip to Soviet country and, based on the current
political climate, I may never see him again. Before he parts, I wanted to honor
him in the best and only way I can - with a new alarm.
